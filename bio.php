                I graduated from Myers Park High School in Charlotte, NC. After high school I attended Central Piedmont Community College.
                I love working hard to solve challenges and all the knowledge that comes of that process. When I'm not working I enjoy
                spending time with friends and family, reading, and volunteering.
